# CODSOFT-DS-INTERNSHIP
This repository contains the results of the tasks assigned by CODSOFT during my Machine Learning Internship.

Task : 2 – Movie Rating Prediction
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict movie ratings using the IMDB dataset downloaded from Kaggle, as per CODSOFT instructions. I implemented a Linear Regression model using Python and Scikit-Learn. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization using multiple charts for analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation using appropriate performance metrics.

Task : 3 – Iris Flower Classification
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using the dataset downloaded from Kaggle, as per CODSOFT guidelines. Multiple classification algorithms were implemented using Python and Scikit-Learn. Model accuracy was evaluated using standard evaluation metrics. From the results, Random Forest showed higher training performance, while Logistic Regression provided consistent accuracy on both training and testing data.

Task : 4 – Sales Prediction
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict sales based on historical data. The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed to understand the relationship between features influencing sales. A regression-based approach was implemented using Python and Scikit-Learn, and the model performance was evaluated using suitable evaluation metrics to measure prediction accuracy.
